## Summary

<!--
  Write a paragraph describing the change you want to happen,
  and how this benefits us. Here's an example:

    Let's have a standard way of proposing things within MG.
    When someone has an idea for something that can be implemented
    team-wide or organization-wide, let's do so in an RFC Document.

    This will give everyone a voice on changes they want to see
    happen in MG, tech-related or otherwise. This will also give us
    a forum to discuss proposals from the entire organization in
   one place.
